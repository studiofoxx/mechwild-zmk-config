# The default is to use the global thread for encoders.
# If you find this unresponsive, consider commenting this out and uncommenting the line after to give the encoder processing its own thread.
# Alternately, consider switching to the dedicated QDEC encoder peripheral if that is an option.
CONFIG_EC11_TRIGGER_GLOBAL_THREAD=y
#CONFIG_EC11_TRIGGER_OWN_THREAD=y

### QOL SETTINGS ###

# Uncomment to increase the transmit power of the keyboard's BLE radio.
# This will help if the connection to the host is poor/inconsistent.
#CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_PLUS_8=y

# Uncomment and modify the number to change the number of BLE profiles/pairings.
# Don't uncomment here if you have a split keyboard; you will need to create separate config files.
#CONFIG_BT_MAX_CONN=8
#CONFIG_BT_MAX_PAIRED=8

# Uncomment to enable passkey entry for improved security. Make sure your keymaps all have numbers!
# You will need to re-pair your keyboard with all hosts after enabling this.
# CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_PASSKEY_ENTRY=y

# Uncomment to enable experimental BLE settings.
# What exactly these settings are will vary as ZMK development progresses, so CHECK BEFORE ENABLING. https://zmk.dev/docs/config/bluetooth#kconfig
#CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES=y

### POWER-SAVING SETTINGS ###

# How long before the board goes idle, which turns off LEDs and displays (ms). 600000 ms = 10 min.
#CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT=600000

# Uncomment to disable deep sleep.
# In deep sleep the board will also disconnect from Bluetooth and cut external power.
# It may take several seconds for a board to wake from deep sleep after a key is pressed.
# Note: Deep sleep is currently exclusive to nRF52 MCUs (PillBug/nice!nano).
#CONFIG_ZMK_SLEEP=n

# How long the board will stay in idle mode before going to deep sleep (ms). 3600000 ms = 1 hour.
#CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_SLEEP_TIMEOUT=3600000

### RGB SETTINGS ###

# Uncomment to disable RGB.
# Note: RGB is exclusive to nRF52 (PillBug/nice!nano) until a GPIO or PWM binding is created for BlackPill boards.
#CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW=n

# Uncommenting will allow you to turn RGB off without cutting power to the external power pin. This is useful when the display uses the same power source as the RGB LEDs.
# Unfortunately, it has a huge impact on battery life since the RGB LEDs draw significant power even when "turned off". Cutting power to the LEDs is the only way to prevent this.
# Not recommended for batteries under 500 mAh.
#CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_EXT_POWER=n

# Uncomment to turn off RGB when the keyboard goes idle.
#CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_AUTO_OFF_IDLE=y

# Uncomment to turn off RGB when the keyboard is disconnected from USB.
#CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_AUTO_OFF_USB=y

### LOGGING SETTINGS ###

# Uncomment to turn on logging over USB.
# Note: Logging over USB is currently exclusive to nRF52 MCUs (PillBug/nice!nano).
#CONFIG_ZMK_USB_LOGGING=y

# Uncomment to increase the log buffer size. This may help if the log messages you're looking for seem to be getting dropped.
#CONFIG_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=8192

# Uncomment to delay the log output. This may help catch issues close to startup.
#CONFIG_LOG_PROCESS_THREAD_STARTUP_DELAY_MS=3000

CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y
CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=n
